# Free Mission Chief Bot

A bot written to automate the general despatching jobs of the bot, simply follow the guide and let it run. No fee to pay, no license required. 

This was made to combat the issue of the [older bot](https://github.com/codesidian/Python-MissionChiefBot) being slow, and also difficult for users to install. Everything is there ready for the user at one click of a button.
Find the scan report of the exe [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file-analysis/ODM5NDNhYjMzNjgwNjI0MDQ2ZDcwNTE4ODZkOTIzNjM6MTU4Nzc3NzYwMQ==/detection) incase you're worried it's a virus. 

## Features
- Send only a batch of missions at a time - set `missions_per_run ` to the amount required in your `config.ini`.
- Super fast, the bot is built with speed in mind! With the ability to despatch around 131 missions in around **6 minutes**.
- Multiple domains supported, .co.uk, .com, .it.
- Multiple accounts at one time, just create another bot in another folder and off you go.


## How to use
Download the code [here](https://github.com/jackbayliss/Mission-Chief-Bot/archive/master.zip), then extract the files to a folder of your choice (Just keep the files together)

Once done open the `config.ini` inside the config folder and replace corresponding `username` and `password` with your account information, and `server` with the country  your account is registered on such as `uk`. All working countries will be in the `server.ini`

`missions_per_run` is the amount of missions it will do per batch, so if it finds 100 missions and you've set it to 50 it will *ONLY* do 50. Set `show_own `to true if you want to ignore alliance missions, else set it to false.

### Windows
Just double click the .exe and you're up and running!

## Why is the source code hidden?
This is to mainly prevent the developers of the website seeing exactly how the bot is able to do it so quickly, this is more of a prolonging the life of the bot exercise.
